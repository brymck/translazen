pp\_yaku\_zen
=============

Add functionality for translators to PowerPoint. Designed to increase in
usefulness as the design and wording choices of the origin authors increase in
awfulness.

Installation 
------------

If you haven't already, sigh as you boot up Windows, then get
[Git](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/). Make sure PowerPoint is closed.

Open the command prompt and copy-and-paste the following:

    git clone git://github.com/brymck/pp_yaku_zen.git
    cp pp_yaku_zen/pp_yaku_zen.ppa %AppData%\Microsoft\Addins

Open PowerPoint and select the add-in:

* 2007+: Office Button > PowerPoint Options > Add-Ins > Select "PowerPoint
  Add-ins" in the Manage drop-down > Go... > Add New... > Select
  pp\_yaku\_zen > OK > Close
* Earlier: Tools > Add-ins > Add New... > Select pp\_yaku\_zen > OK > Close

Updating
--------

Go to the original directory called `pp_yaku_zen` where you first downloaded
this repository and run:

    git pull
    cp pp_yaku_zen/pp_yaku_zen.ppa %AppData%\Microsoft\Addins

Happy (or at least less miserable) editing!
