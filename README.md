pp\_yaku\_zen
=============

Add functionality for translators to PowerPoint. Designed to increase in
usefulness as the design and wording choices of the origin authors increase in
awfulness.

Installation 
------------

(Note: These instructions work for updating, also.)

If you haven't already, sigh as you boot up Windows, then get
[Git](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/). Make sure PowerPoint is closed.

Open the command prompt and copy-and-paste the following:

    git clone git://github.com/brymck/pp_yaku_zen.git
    cp pp_yaku_zen/pp_yaku_zen.ppa %AppData%\Microsoft\Addins
